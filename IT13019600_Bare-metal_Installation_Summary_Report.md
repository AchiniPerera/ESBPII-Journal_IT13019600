#####Introduction to Bare-metal installation#####

**Hypervisor** is a software that allows multiple operating systems(OSs) to run concurrently on a physical machine and to interact directly with the physical hardware. There are two types of hypervisors. They are,

<pre>* Hosted Hypervisor

* Bare-metal Hypervisor </pre>

Bare-metal hypervisor is an operating system.But the Hosted hypervisor installs and runs like as an application. 

Throughout this report it explains the steps that are followed to do Bare-metal installation.


**Step 01** â€“ First create a new virtual machine.
<pre>File -> New Virtual Machine </pre>

* It's highly recommended to allocate at least 4GB of RAM space. The physical machine you use, need to have more than 4 GB of RAM space to do this. 

<pre> Customize -> Add -> Select RAM size as 4GB </pre>

* Make sure to choose NAT as network adapter.
* Click on "Close" button.

**Step 23**- Since I have 4GB RAM in my physical machine I have faced some problems when I work with virtual machine which is already consuming 4GB RAM.
Previously I have done this lab with my colleagues as a collaborative work. Therefore as a solution for that problem I'll put those screen shots from this onward in this report.

* In this window it will ask for IP address, User name and Password. Provide the IP address which you obtain in Step 18. Type the root password which you gave in Step 13. Then click on "Login" button.
